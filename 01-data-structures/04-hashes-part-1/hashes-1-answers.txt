Doubling the size of the inner array on every collision may be a poor solution as it greatly increases the amount of empty indexes within the array. These empty indexes can then fragment the data with more elements being placed on non-contiguous blocks. However, while doubling the size makes the table much more expensive, the greater amount of empty indexes will limit the amount of times the table has to be resized again in the future.
