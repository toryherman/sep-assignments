## Line
The line data structure is simply an array of strings which each represent a person's name. When a person joins the line, the person is pushed onto the end of the array. When a person leaves the line, the element at that index of the array is removed, thereby shifting all elements after it forward. In order to search for a person, you simply loop through the line array until you find a match and return that person.
